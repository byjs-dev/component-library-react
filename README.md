## Intro
This my personal playground for building a react component library with Vite v4 and Storybook v7 and trying out several features.

## Setup
#### Node
Make sure to use the correct Node and NPM versions, as shown in package.json "engines".
If you use nvm, just run ```nvm use``` inside this project's root directory.
